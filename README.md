# Tailwind CSS and Flowbite Example

This project demonstrates the usage of Tailwind CSS and Flowbite components to create a button , a card component, Napbar ,Footer, form etc

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`

## Usage

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Button Component

The `Button` component displays a set of colored buttons with hover effects. Each button has different color styles based on the Tailwind CSS classes applied.

To use the `Button` component, import it and render it in your application:

```jsx
import Button from './Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
## Card Component
The Card component displays a card container with information about students in a bootcamp. It uses Flowbite and Tailwind CSS classes to style the card layout.

To use the Card component, import it and render it in your application:

jsx
Copy code
import Card from './Card';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <Card />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Feel free to customize the components or use them as a starting point for your own Tailwind CSS and Flowbite projects!
In this way you can use all the componets of flowbite with tailwind css as card component and buttom component.
